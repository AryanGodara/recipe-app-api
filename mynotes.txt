1. After Creating All the files, and an empty ./app directory.
   Run the following command in the current directory from the terminal :-

   docker-compose run app sh -c "django-admin.py startproject app ."

   docker-compose run : the syntactical thingy, to run docker-compose commands
   app : the service from the docker-compose.yml file that we want to run
   sh -c : (Optional) Helps to separate the actual command, from the docker-compose syntax

   "" : The command that we want to run
   django-admin.py startproject : I know this from the django course
   app : start the new django project in our current location. (Since the project is running
   on our docker container, for it, the current directory, maps to the 'app' directory through
   bind mounts, which I learnt about in the django-k8s course)
